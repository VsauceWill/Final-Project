       <body>The game starts off disguising itself as an innocent Visual Novel game. The innocent art style and soundtracks of this game really tricks a lot of people thinking this is an innocent game.</li>
       <body>The game begins with the player's childhood friend, Sayori catching up to them and going to school together</li>
       <body>Sayori then asks the player to join the Literature Club, which the player feels hesitant to join. The player ends up joing the Literature Club and it introduced to the other 3 girls. </li>
     
     <ol>

<body>Throughout the game the player has options to choose a certain character route
<ul>
<li>Sayori Route</li>
<li>Natsuki Route</li>
 <li>Yuri Route</li>
</ul>
</ol>
 <body> You can choose a character route by choosing words in your poem that appeal to that character as shown below.
